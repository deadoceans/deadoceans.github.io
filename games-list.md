# PC Game Backlog

A personal backlog of PC games that I own on either GOG or Steam.  It's become quite a lot to keep track of, which is the reason I've made this.  I'm separating them into 3 categories: currently playing, queue, and completed games.

A "completed" game is nothing like 100% achievements.  The criteria is either going through a full playthrough, or rarely, when I feel like dropping the game.

The queue is a rough list of the order I'd like to play the games.

Generally, I play a few games at once, and each of them belongs to a different genre.  However, no more than 2 RPGs at once since these onces tend to be pretty in-depth.

I try to give a game at least a few hours.  No ADHD-like starting and then stopping and moving onto something else, leaving an entire library 15% completed.

I try to leave thoughts and reviews for most of the games I complete.

I'm not going to be buying more games anytime soon.  I'm staying off of the stores with the rare exception of a wishlist item.  I probably have enough games to last me for the entire rest of my life assuming I only play 1-2 hours per day :D
