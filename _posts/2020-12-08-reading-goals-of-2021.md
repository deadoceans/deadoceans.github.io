title: Reading Goals of 2021
---

Among other bad habits that I want to get closer to breaking once and for all during the new years, there are some habits that I want to pick up as well.

One of the primary ones is a consistent reading routine that leads to a certain number of books read in the year.  The goal number of books for me is 10.

### Books

A good balance of fiction as well as nonfiction that interests me or would be helpful professionally.  There are a lot of books that I have not read so I had some trouble coming up with this list at first, because I was faced with the dilemma of too many choices.  What helped was realizing making any list at all and sticking with it would lead to the result of 10 books read vs. 0 due to analysis paralysis, or even worse, several started but none finished.

* **The Brother's Karamazov, Dostoevsky**: Apparent legendary Russian fiction exploring the multitude of ways one can approach life I think.
* **Shadow & Claw, Wolfe**: Dark Souls-like dark fantasy with unorthodox prose.
* **Sword & Citadel, Wolfe**: Part two of above.
* **Master and Margarita, Bulgakov**: More apparent legendary Russian fiction, no idea what it's about.
* **Hard Boiled Wonderland, Murakami**: Loved Norwegian Wood and The Wind Up Bird Chronicle.  Probably something absurd and dreamy.
* **Embassytown, Mieville**: Mieville is great, I think this one explores language in a gritty sci-fi setting.
* **Midnight in Chernobyl, Higginbotham**: Apparent brilliant account and analysis of the Chernobyl disaster.  Highly interesting subject for me.
* **The Sense of Style, Pinker**: A modern book on how to write in a modern fashion.  Writing is something I am working on, so there it is.  Excited for this one.
* **Being and Nothingness, Sartre**: A monster of a book outlining the philosophy of Sartre.  My reading lexile and IQ will both probably substantially increase after painstakingly getting through this one.
* **How Linux Works, Ward**: 340 pages of pure good Linux stuff starting from the basics.  I like Linux and I want to get more into SysAdmin type of stuff, so this is a great book both for general knowledge and preparation for the RHCSA and other certs.

### Sacrifice

Playing video games is usually the last thing I do before bed once everything else is done.  Instead of doing this, I am going to read.  Only Monday through Thursday.  Friday evening and some parts of Saturday and Sunday I will play games, but I want to reserve weekday evenings for getting in at least an hour of reading, ideally 2-3.

### Habit/Schedule

Habit stacking.  My current routine (or what I try to strive for and not always meet) is, after work, doing the following:
1. Drawing
2. Some form of writing
3. Play video games

It will change to this:
1. Drawing
2. Some form of writing
3. Turn off PC and read

Easy enough.  My general daily schedule will look like this:
1. Wake up at 6:00
2. Meditate
3. Workout (if it's a workout day)
4. Study for RHCSA
5. Work Shift
6. Drawing
7. Writing
8. Reading
9. Sleep

I will throw some time in for Piano and/or Guitar somewhere.  After I finished the RHCSA, that is going to be replaced with more intensive study of Russian.

### Stipulations

Two things here to enhance the experience.

* **Nonfiction Notes**: When I read any nonfiction books, I'm going to try to make notes on what I read for more active reading and retention of information.  This will probably be done electronically, so will require my PC.
* **Vocabulary**: If I don't know a word, I'm going to write it down with the page number and underline it.  Then on Sundays, I'm going to compile and add words to a growing list of vocabulary words, where the card contains the definition of the word and the sentence I found it in for context.
