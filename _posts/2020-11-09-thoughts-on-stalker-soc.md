The atmosphere of this thing.  It's like nothing I have experienced before in a video game.

Chernobyl, nuclear disasters, radiation, and post apocalyptic wastelands containing a severely dwindled human population have always interested me.  S.T.A.L.K.E.R. encapsulates all of those things.  The dark, ominous, overcast sky that looks like the curse of a deity upon this wicked world, the ravaged trees and wildlife that beget eerie silence, the sense of emptiness and peace that comes attached to the ambience of walking alone among ruins, the fear of an environment and alien lifeforms that are hostile to your existence.  It's all right here.

I was skeptical of S.T.A.L.K.E.R. SOC at first.  It's an older game.  When I booted it up for the first time and saw the low quality cutscene and subsequent awkward dialogue, I wasn't particularly impressed or intrigued to say the least.  But I gave it a chance and it was one of the most rewarding and unique experiences I have had in a game.

S.T.A.L.K.E.R. is an open world, first person shooter.  It wouldn't exactly be classified as an RPG due to its lack of RPG mechanics, but I think it truly is a role-playing game in the fundamental definition of what that means.  In other words, this game actually makes you feel like a S.T.A.L.K.E.R. living and working amid the devastated environment of the post Chernobyl-NPP disaster.

To provide some background, S.T.A.L.K.E.R. is inspired by the post-apocalyptic science fiction novel, *Roadside Picnic,* published by Russian authors Arkady and Boris Strugatsky.  Instead of "The Zone" (an anomalous area of strange space-time events and radioactivity where the game takes place) being caused by an extraterrestrial event as in *Roadside Picnic*, The Zone was created as a result of incomprehensible events taking place after the Chernobyl NPP disaster.  You play the role of a S.T.A.L.K.E.R. - a wanderer who ventures into the zone in search of high-value artifacts.

Although inspired in many ways by *Roadside Picnic*, S.T.A.L.K.E.R. is, in my opinion, primarily a product of the culture that was spawned by the fascination of the long reaching and esoteric effects of nuclear disasters, with the *Metro* and *Fallout* series belonging to this same category.
