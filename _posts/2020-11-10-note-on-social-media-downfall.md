It must've been 8-10 years ago, probably around the age of 16 years old, that I predicted not only the deleterious effects of mainstream social media on the human psyche and the cascade of mental illness it would cause or exacerbate, but also the fact that they make an insidious tool to manipulate the perception of their users to influence everything from societal norms and virtues to political outcomes according to their own bias.

As people are finally waking up to this in 2020 and deleting their Facebook and Twitter accounts in droves in favor of freer and non-biased social media platforms where their voices are not silenced, the only thing I can do is sit back in ecstasy and bliss as I watch the downfall of true evil. My pipe dream is that Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, YouTube, etc., being the cesspools that they are, are completely wiped off of the face of the planet.

Until this becomes a reality, I can only smile at the likely probability of their once astronomical monetary incomes slowly decreasing as they are able to exploit and manipulate less and less people.

As consumers we are ultimately the ones who control this game, no matter what the companies themselves might think. Without our existence they do not exist, so it's up to us to support what is morally beneficial for our species by picking and choosing who and what we give our time, attention, and data to.

It may not stop with Zuckerberg or Dorsey (the 43 year old man with a 14 year old girl's nose ring who thinks he owns the world), but the iconoclasm of these men and their technology, or even skepticism towards them, are a massive step in the right direction and will give us some respite, however brief it may be.
