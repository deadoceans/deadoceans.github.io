Software Engineer specializing in Qt/QML, embedded systems, Linux, and general desktop and touchscreen application development.  I received my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from the University of Richmond in 2017 and hold certifications in Linux+ and Security+.

Ironically skeptical of technology and the impact it is having on the human soul.  

Zero social media and an advocate of privacy and a focused and meaningful life lived by a personal sense of what is right.

Perpetual existentialist continuously trying to crawl my way out of reaching a nihilistic conclusion.

More interested in the human condition than boolean statements.

I enjoy video games (DRM free, GOG is best girl), reading books, writing, piano, calisthenics, anime, language learning, traveling to different countries, and peace and quiet.  I wish I could draw vast, post apocalyptic environments.  Maybe it's something I will work on.
