</figure> Software Engineer specializing in Qt/QML, embedded systems, Linux, and general desktop and touchscreen application development.  Ironically skeptic of technology and the impact it is having on the human brain.  Zero social media and advocate of privacy and a focused and meaningful life lived by your own sense of what is right.  I enjoy video games, reading books, writing, piano, calisthenics, anime, language learning, traveling to different countries, and peace and quiet.  I wish I could draw vast, post apocalyptic environments.  Maybe it's something I will work on.
