</figure> Software Engineer specializing in Qt/QML, embedded systems, Linux, and general desktop and touchscreen application development.  Ironically skeptical of technology and the impact it is having on the human psyche.  

Zero social media, don't support virtue signaling monopolies, and advocate of privacy and a focused and meaningful life lived by your own sense of what is right.  
Perpetual existentialist continuously trying to crawl my way out of reaching nihilism.  

I enjoy video games, reading books, writing, piano, calisthenics, anime, language learning, traveling to different countries, and peace and quiet.  I wish I could draw vast, post apocalyptic environments.  Maybe it's something I will work on.
